# Category 4 — Docs / Content / Productivity

## Objective
Add high-value support skills without polluting engineering core workflows.

## Source Positioning
- awesome-claude-skills is primary source for this category
- superpowers is secondary/supporting here

## Inclusion Bands
1. Engineering-adjacent docs
2. Research and synthesis
3. Productivity operations

## Admission Criteria (must meet)
1. Clear input/output contract
2. Verifiable output quality
3. Explicit tool dependencies
4. Context-efficient structure
5. Low accidental trigger risk

## Invocation Policy
- Default to explicit invocation (`disable-model-invocation: true`)
- Enable implicit invocation only for low-risk, high-confidence helper skills

## Authoring Policy
- Keep SKILL.md concise
- Move large guidance to references/
- Enforce strict output templates

## Preferred Golden Set Types
- changelog/release note generation
- meeting/transcript summarization
- research brief generation
- doc polish and consistency passes
- structured report generation

## Patch Notes
- Keep niche/platform-specific skills out of core
- Place them in presets or optional packs
